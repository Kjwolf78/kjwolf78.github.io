title: Career Goals
---

My focus in the Tech Industry is to obtain a job working with a strong
company that is also willing to train.

I have learned so much from the Bloc Front End Web Developer program
but, as I learned after I got my BS in Hotel/Hospitality at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas, it requires experience on the job. I chose Front End
development because I have always been artistic and creative. I love to
make the eye as excited as the user visiting a website. This is only the
beginning for me in the industry. I intend to never stop learning and always
challenge myself to eventually become a Full Stack Developer.
