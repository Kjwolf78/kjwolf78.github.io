title: Bloc Front End Web Development Course
---

Coding is certainly not the easiest skill to learn.

It truly is teaching your brain to read and speak multiple new languages.
The assistance provided by my brother and my friends that are in the
industry helped me to get started. The course I took with Bloc dove much
deeper and taught me HTML/CSS/JavaScript/DOM
Scripting/jQuery/AngularJS to name a few.

The course not only provided in depth descriptive exercises, but also a
mentor I met with multiple times weekly. Because of these resources, I
learned about my style of solving and development.
