title: Bloc Front End Web Development Course
---

Coding is most certainly not the easiest thing to learn. 

It truly is teaching your brain to read and speak multiple new languages. The assistance provided by my brother and friends that are already in the industry helped me get started. The course I took with Bloc dove much deeper and taught me HTML/CSS/Javascript/DOM Scripting/JQuery/AngularJS to name a few. 

The course not only provided in depth descriptive exercises but also a mentor I met with multiple times weekly. With both of these assets I learned about myself and my style of problem solving as well as development.
