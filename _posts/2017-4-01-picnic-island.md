title: Discovering a True Passion
---

I spent many years in the Hotel/Hospitality industry while living in the
increasingly beautiful city of Las Vegas. YES, I was being sarcastic if you
were wondering ;-).

I was ready for a change, which brought me to Tampa, Florida. It is a
beautiful city and I love living here. I have always had a desire for
adventure. Different places and cultures are fascinating to me. I reached a
point in Hospitality where I knew it wasnâ€™t for me and it was time to find a
new adventure professionally. As it happens, I have a brother who is a
computer programmer and told me he always thought I would enjoy
Mobile App Development, for as a child I loved building Legos and solving
puzzles. It was at this moment I had no clue my future would start. With his
help, I dove in and built my first app based on a local beach here in Tampa.
After rediscovered my love for building visibly creative projects and solving
issues throughout the entire process, I entered the Bloc Front End Web
Developer program to educate myself and prepare to change my life and
my career!
