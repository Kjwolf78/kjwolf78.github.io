title: Discovering a True Passion
---

I spent many years in the Hotel/Hospitality industry mainly while living in the ever beautiful city of Las Vegas, yes I was being sarcastic if you are asking yourself ;-). 

I was ready for a change which brought me here to Tampa, Florida and I must say, I do love this city. I have always had a sense for adventure and figuring out new places and cultures. I reached a point in Hospitality where I knew it wasnâ€™t for me and it was time for me to find a new adventure professionally. It so happens I have a brother who is a computer programmer and told me he always thought I would enjoy Mobile App Development for as a child I loved building Legos and solving puzzles. It was at this moment I had no clue my future would start. With his help, I dove in and built my first app based on a local beach here in Tampa. After I rediscovered my love for building visibly creative projects and solving issues throughout the entire process, I entered the Bloc Front End Web Developer program to educate myself and prepare to change my life and my career!
